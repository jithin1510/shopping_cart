# Environment Variables Configuration

This application uses environment variables for configuration. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

## Database Configuration
```
DB_CONNECTION_STRING=mongodb://localhost:27017/shopping-cart
TEST_DB_CONNECTION_STRING=mongodb://localhost:27017/test-shopping-cart
```

## JWT Configuration
```
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_secret_key
JWT_EXPIRATION_TIME=30d
```

## Email Configuration
```
MAIL_SERVICE=gmail
MAIL_USERNAME=your_email@gmail.com
MAIL_PASSWORD=your_app_password
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=noreply@shoppingcart.com
```

### Important Note for Gmail Users
If you're using Gmail as your email service, you need to:

1. Enable 2-Factor Authentication on your Google account
2. Generate an App Password:
   - Go to your Google Account settings
   - Navigate to Security
   - Under "Signing in to Google," select "App passwords"
   - Generate a new app password for "Mail" and "Other (Custom name)"
   - Use this generated password as your `MAIL_PASSWORD` in the .env file

The error message `"Invalid login: 535-5.7.8 Username and Password not accepted"` typically occurs when:
- You're using your regular Gmail password instead of an App Password
- The email address or password is incorrect
- Google has blocked the sign-in attempt due to security reasons
